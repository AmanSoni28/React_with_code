// npm(node packege manager) => when we install 'node' npm also include, that allow to install libraries
// npx(Node Package Execute) => without install, run the libraries from npm



/* ++++++++++++++++++ React project are create(install) in two Ways ++++++++++++++++++
1 way
   npx create-react-app <project name>            note: The create react app is a tool(sostware) used to create a new React Project
   dir => use to show all directories
   npm run start        //to run start script
   npm run build        //to run build script

   when we create a project with react(only) this is time taken to install and bulky for that we not use this method to create project 

2 Way (using vite)
npm create vite@latest

note:when react project is create using vite then 'node_modules' is not present

npm i or npm install   //install all the required package
dir => use to show all directories
npm run dev          //to run dev(start) script
npm run build        //to run build script
