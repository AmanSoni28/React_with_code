<--------------------------------props------------------------------->
In React.js, props (short for "properties") are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component. Props are read-only and help make components dynamic and reusable.

How Props Work:

Props are passed as attributes to a child component. They allow data to be passed from a parent component to a child. Props are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed inside the child component.

in this project 'App' function is parent component and 'Ankit' function is child componenet
